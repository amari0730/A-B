                For the website I changed the appointments so that they popped out from the page.
                I also altered the header to be more rounded off. Also I rounded off the dashboard.

                                I assume that the Null Hypothesis will be proven incorrect, because of the differences in the web pages designs.

                                I assume the misclick rate for Website A will be smaller because the user is more used to that particular site rather than 
                                the site B. I choose to make the design of site B less accessible and less manuevarble, so that it would be harder for the user
                                to select the correct option.

                                I assume that the Null Hypothesis will be proven correct. Although I do believe that the Alternative Hypothesis does have
                                some affect on the user, I assume that it would relatively be the same for both experiences.

                                My predicition that the user spends slightly more time on website B than A is because of the design choices. They dont have any particular
                                reasoning and makes the website look more messy. Which in term, I think will make the user spend a little longer time on the website. However,
                                I do think that both sites will relatively have the same times.

                    <h4>Misclick: Chi-Squared Test</h4>
                    <p>For Website A the misclick was 7 (21.21%)</p>
                    <p>For Website B the misclick was 2 (9.52%)</p>
                    <p>T-Score: 1.14</p>
                    <p>P-Value: 0.672</p>
                    <p>Degrees of Freedom: 51.32</p>
                    <p>
                        For this test I Choose the Chi-Squared test because this is more of a classification task. In other 
                        words the user can belong to one of two categories, either correct click or incorrect click.  The difference
                        between version A and B is definetly staticically significant. The important value is the p value is .67 which 
                        is significantly greater than the baseline of .05. Thus, I would say that this particular result rejects the null hypothesis.

                <div class="section">
                    <h4>Time on Page: T-test</h4>
                    <p>For Website A the average time was 12,860.44 ms</p>
                    <p>For Website B the average time was 6,501.90 ms</p>
                    <p>T-Score: 3.011</p>

                    <p>Degrees of Freedom: 34.26</p>
                    <p>
                        The reason that I chose the T-test for this particular metric is because it is a continuous scenario,
                        and is dependent on the time interval, which is not categorical. The difference between these two pages is definetly staticically
                        significant. I determined this based on the y value which is approximately .998 which is significantly
                        greater than 0.05. This rejects the null hypothesis.
                    </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h4>Click Time/ T-test</h4>
                    <p>For Website A the average time was 5,542.94 ms</p>
                    <p>For Website B the average time was 3,3228.52 ms</p>
                    <p>T-Score: 2.870</p>
                    <p>P-Score0.997</p>
                    <p>degrees of freedom: 41.49</p>
                    <p>
                        I chose T-Test for this scenario. Similar to the other metric, this metric is continous. Again this 
                        shows that there is s agrate staticical signifance between these two sites. The p value is 0.997 which is 
                        significanlty greater than 0.05. Thus the results are signifant. Also this rejects the null hypothesis

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>For this particular section of the testing I chose to do two different staticical testing methods. For the first 
                    test I choose to calculate the percentage of the proper clicks relative to the overall number of clicks. And as you can 
                    see there is a significant difference between these two values. I chose this because it is a simple way to generalize the 
                    data. In terms of the other two tests I chose to do a mean. This is because it allows me to generalize the data 
                    and simply show that on average how long it took the users to click the correct button and simply click. Having these two metrics allows
                    the tester, myself, to see the relationship between correct clicks and the time it takes to make the correct click
                    relative to the amount of overall clicks.
