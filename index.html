                For the website I changed the appointments so that they popped out from the page.
                I also altered the header to be more rounded off. Also I rounded off the dashboard.

                                I assume that the Null Hypothesis will be proven incorrect, because of the differences in the web pages designs.

                                I assume the misclick rate for Website A will be smaller because the user is more used to that particular site rather than 
                                the site B. I choose to make the design of site B less accessible and less manuevarble, so that it would be harder for the user
                                to select the correct option.

                                I assume that the Null Hypothesis will be proven correct. Although I do believe that the Alternative Hypothesis does have
                                some affect on the user, I assume that it would relatively be the same for both experiences.

                                My predicition that the user spends slightly more time on website B than A is because of the design choices. They dont have any particular
                                reasoning and makes the website look more messy. Which in term, I think will make the user spend a little longer time on the website. However,
                                I do think that both sites will relatively have the same times.

                    <p>Chi^2: 0.00912</p>
                    <p>P-Value: 0.923</p>
                    <p>Degrees of Freedom: 1</p>
                    <p>
                        For this test I Choose the Chi-Squared test because this is more of a classification task. In other 
                        words the user can belong to one of two categories, either correct click or incorrect click.  The difference
                        between version A and B is definetly staticically insignificant. The important value is the p value is .923. 
                        Thus, I would say that this particular result fails to reject the null hypothesis, and Website A does not have significantly more mislicks than
                        website B.

                    <p>P-Value: 0.998</p>

                    <p>Variance(B): 144.5</p>
                    <p>
                        The reason that I chose the One-Tail-T-test for this particular metric is because it is a continuous scenario and it is important
                        to see whether users who used Website A is took longer than Website B, and is dependent on the time interval, which is not categorical. The difference between these two pages is definetly staticically
                        significant. I determined this based on the y value which is approximately .998 which 1 - .998 is less than .05,
                        stating that users who used website A did take signifcantly more time than website B, ultimately rejecting my null hypothesis.

                    <p>Variance(B): 1666849.362</p>
                    <p>
                        I chose Two-Tailed-T-Test for this scenario. Similar to the second metric, this metric is continous, and I wanted to see
                        if the values were equivalent to one another or different. In other words, I wanted to see if the users for both websites take roughly the same amount
                        of time to perform a click or if they take a different amount of time. Again this shows that there is a signifance between these two sites. The p value is 0.00643 which is 
                        significanlty less 0.05. Thus the results implicate that the websites do not in fact take the same amount of time to perform a click and the 
                        Null Hypothesis is rejected. And am confident that my Alternative hypothesis is not correct.

                <p>
                    Ultiamtely the shapes of the data are drastically different 
                    with the A sample having 33 participants and the B sample only having 21. When it comes to the overall mean for all of the tests,
                    initially the first test shows both data have a low misclick rate. The second test shows that for A, users spent relatively more time than on
                    website B. The final metric Proved the user was able to make their first click quicker on site B than site A. OVerall, the means of these metrics confirm the outcomes that were derived by the 
                    different tests. When it comes to the mode, for each of the metrics, sample A has larger values. Ultiamtely the shape of both data shows that there was a wider range of inputs (more data points) for sample A relative
                    to sample B. This could definitely affect the overall data of the metrics and prove to heavily influence the shape of the outcomes for the data.
